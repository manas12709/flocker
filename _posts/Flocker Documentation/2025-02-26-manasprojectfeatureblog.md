You’re not just building for now—you’re building for next year’s students. This project is all about redesigning and documenting the **Flocker social media site** to help future AP CSP students learn faster, code smarter, and build with confidence. It’s about passing the torch—with style, support, and solid code.

## 🧠 Mindset: Learn. Build. Pass It On.  

This isn’t just a school project—it’s a toolkit for future coders. We’re writing the docs, solving the bugs, and simplifying the steps so students can focus on what matters: creating something cool.

Let’s make Flocker not just a website, but a **launchpad for learning.**
